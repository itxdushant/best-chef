<h3>1. Contractual Relationship</h3>
<p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access or use, from within the United States and its territories and possessions, of the applications, websites, content, products, and services (the "Services," as more fully defined below in Section 3) made available in the United States and its territories and possessions by Best Local Chef. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND BEST LOCAL CHEF.</p>
<p>By accessing or using the Services, you confirm your agreement to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Services. These Terms expressly supersede prior agreements or arrangements with you. Best Local Chef may immediately terminate these Terms or any Services with respect to you, or generally cease offering or deny access to the Services or any portion thereof, at any time for any reason.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: PLEASE REVIEW THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SET FORTH BELOW CAREFULLY, AS IT WILL REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH Best Local Chef ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION. BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND HAVE TAKEN TIME TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS IMPORTANT DECISION.</p>
<p>	
Supplemental terms may apply to certain Services, such as policies for a particular event, program, activity or promotion, and such supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in separate region-specific disclosures (e.g., a particular city webpage on BestLocalChef.com) or in connection with the applicable Service(s). Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes of the applicable Service(s). Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event of a conflict with respect to the applicable Services.</p>
<p>	
Best Local Chef may amend the Terms from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon Best Local Chef's posting of such updated Terms at this location or in the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service(s). Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting confirms your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended. If Best Local Chef changes these Terms after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Best Local Chef written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above. This written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, Best Local Chef or (b) by email from the email address associated with your Account to: info@BestLocalChef.com. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to these Terms. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will continue to be bound by the provisions of these Terms as of the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to these Terms).</pr>

<div id="agreement" class="cont"> 
	<h3>2. Arbitration Agreement</h3>
	<p>By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against Best Local Chef on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against Best Local Chef, and also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class, collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against Best Local Chef by someone else.
</p>
	<strong>Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and Best Local Chef.</strong>
	<p>You and Best Local Chef agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to (a) these Terms or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or (b) your access to or use of the Services at any time, whether before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Best Local Chef, and not in a court of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where you allege claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of the Services, you may elect to bring those claims in a court of competent jurisdiction instead of arbitration. Best Local Chef agrees to honor your election of forum with respect to your individual sexual assault or sexual harassment claim but in so doing does not waive the enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited to, the waivers provided in the following paragraph, which will continue to apply in court and arbitration), controversy, claim or dispute.
</p>
	<p>You acknowledge and agree that you and Best Local Chef are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Unless both you and Best Local Chef otherwise agree in writing, any arbitration will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative proceeding. However, you and Best Local Chef each retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>
	<strong>Rules and Governing Law.</strong>
	<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
</p>
	<p>The parties agree that the arbitrator ("Arbitrator"), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.</p>
	<p>Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ("FAA"), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state of Texas.</p>
	
	<strong>Process.</strong>
<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). The Arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney specifically licensed to practice law in the state of Texas and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<strong>Location and Procedure.</strong>
	
<p>Unless you and Best Local Chef otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Best Local Chef submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
	
<b>Arbitrator's Decision.</b>
<p>	The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. An Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Best Local Chef will not seek, and hereby waives all rights Best Local Chef may have under applicable law to recover attorneys' fees and expenses if Best Local Chef prevails in arbitration.</p>
<b>Fees.</b>
<p>	Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Best Local Chef will pay all such fees, unless the Arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
Changes.</p>				
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions in Section I above, regarding consent to be bound by amendments to these Terms, if Best Local Chef changes this Arbitration Agreement after the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms), you may reject any such change by providing Best Local Chef written notice of such rejection within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Effective" date above. This written notice must be provided either (a) by mail or hand delivery to our registered agent for service of process, c/o Best Local Chef, LLC, by email from the email address associated with your Account to: info@bestlocalchef.com. In order to be effective, the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this Arbitration Agreement. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between you and Best Local Chef in accordance with the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first agreed to the Terms (or to any subsequent changes to the Terms).</p>
<strong>Severability and Survival.</strong>
<p>If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>

					</div>
					<div id="payment" class="cont">
						<h3>5. Payment</h3>
	<p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive ("Charges"). Best Local Chef will receive and/or enable your payment of the applicable Charges for services or goods obtained through your use of the Services. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include other applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments. 
</p>
	<p>All Charges and payments will be enabled by Best Local Chef using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which you will receive a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Best Local Chef may use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Best Local Chef.
</p>
	<p>As between you and Best Local Chef, Best Local Chef reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Best Local Chef's sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. Best Local Chef will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Best Local Chef may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for Services at any time prior to the commencement of such Services, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on a Third Party Provider’s behalf. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback. Best Local Chef may use the proceeds of any Charges for any purpose, subject to any payment obligations it has agreed to with any Third Party Providers or other third parties.
</p>
	<p>
	In certain cases, with respect to Third Party Providers, Charges you incur will be owed directly to Third Party Providers, and Best Local Chef will collect payment of those charges from you, on the Third Party Provider’s behalf as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the Charges shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Charges you incur will be owed to the Third Party Provider. Best Local Chef will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate a Third Party Provider, if applicable, for the services or goods obtained in connection with your use of the Services. In all other cases, Charges you incur will be owed and paid directly to Best Local Chef or its affiliates, where Best Local Chef is solely liable for any obligations to Third Party Providers. In such cases, you retain the right to request lower Charges from Best Local Chef for services or goods received by you from a Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Best Local Chef will respond accordingly to any request from you to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. Any representation by Best Local Chef (on Best Local Chef's website, in the Application, or in Best Local Chef's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Best Local Chef provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to a Third Party Provider you may use. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.

	</p>
	<strong>Repair, Cleaning or Lost and Found Fees.</strong>
	<p>You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, a chef's cooking materials and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal "wear and tear" damages and necessary cleaning ("Repair or Cleaning"). In the event that a Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Best Local Chef in Best Local Chef's reasonable discretion, Best Local Chef reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts, as well as those pertaining to lost and found goods, will be transferred by Best Local Chef to a Third Party Provider, if applicable, and are non-refundable.

						<p>THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER IN THIS SECTION DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS, Best Local Chef’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

						<strong>Indemnity.</strong>
						<p>You agree to indemnify and hold Best Local Chef and its affiliates and their officers, directors, employees, and agents harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees), arising out of or in connection with: (i) your use of the Services or services or goods obtained through your use of the Services; (ii) your breach or violation of any of these Terms; (iii) Best Local Chef's use of your User Content; or (iv) your violation of the rights of any third party, including Third Party Providers.</p>

Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the expiration of 48 hours after mailing or posting (if sent by first class mail or pre-paid post) or 12 hours after sending (if sent by email or telephone). You may give notice to Best Local Chef, with such notice deemed given when received by Best Local Chef, at any time by first class mail or pre-paid post to our registered agent for service of process.</p>

						<p>You may not assign these Terms without Best Local Chef's prior written approval. Best Local Chef may assign these Terms without your consent to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of Best Local Chef's equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void.

If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. Best Local Chef's failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Best Local Chef in writing.
