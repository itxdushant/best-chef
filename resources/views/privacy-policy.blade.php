	<h3>The Scope of This Policy</h3>
	<p>This policy applies to all Best Local Chef users, including professional chefs (including professional chef applicants), and to all Best Local Chef platforms and services, including our apps, websites, features, and other services (collectively, the “Best Local Chef Platform”). Please remember that your use of the Best Local Chef Platform is also subject to our <a href="{{route('terms-of-use')}}">Terms of Service.</a>
</p>
</div>
<div id="services" class="cont">
	<h3>The Information We Collect</h3>
	<p>When you use the Best Local Chef Platform, we collect the information you provide, usage information, and information about your device. We also collect information about you from other sources like third party services, and optional programs in which you participate, which we may combine with other information we have about you. Here are the types of information we collect about you:

</p>
<strong>A. Information You Provide to Us</strong>
<p>Account Registration. When you create an account with Best Local Chef, we collect the information you provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, birth date, and payment information. You may choose to share additional info with us for your customer profile, like your photo or saved addresses (e.g., home or work), and set up other preferences (such as your favorite chef).</p>
<p>Chef Information. If you apply to be a Chef, we will collect the information you provide in your application, including your name, email address, phone number, birth date, profile photo, physical address, government identification number (such as social security number), Chef’s license information, certification information, and general liability insurance information. We collect the payment information you provide us, including your bank routing numbers, and tax information. Depending on where you want to provide your cooking services, we may also ask for additional business license or permit information. We may need additional information from you at some point after you become a Chef, including information to confirm your identity (like a photo).
Ratings and Feedback. When you rate and provide feedback about Customers or Chefs, we collect all of the information you provide in your feedback.</p>
<p>ommunications. When you contact us or we contact you, we collect any information that you provide, including the contents of the messages or attachments you send us.</p>
<strong>B. Information We Collect When You Use the Best Local Chef Platform</strong>
<p>	Location Information. Choosing the best chef starts searching for chefs in your local area. The Best Local Chef Platform collects location information (including GPS and WiFi data) differently depending on your Best Local Chef app settings and device permissions as well as whether you are using the platform as a Customer or Chef:</p>
<ul>	
<li>	Customers: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the Best Local Chef app, including while the app is running in the background from the time you request a ride until it ends. </li>
<li>	
Chefs: We collect your device’s precise location when you open and use the app, including while the app is running in the background when it is in Chef mode. We also collect precise location for a limited time after you exit Chef mode in order to detect customer incidents, and continue collecting it until a reported or detected incident is no longer active.</li>
</ul>	
<p>	
Usage Information. We collect information about your use of the Best Local Chef Platform, including services information like the date, time, destination, location, meal, payment, and whether you used a promotional or referral code. We also collect information about your interactions with the Best Local Chef Platform like our apps and websites, including the pages and content you view and the dates and times of your use.</p>
<p>

We collect information about the devices you use to access the Best Local Chef Platform, including device model, IP address, type of browser, version of operating system, identity of carrier and manufacturer, radio type (such as 4G), preferences and settings (such as preferred language), application installations, device identifiers, advertising identifiers, and push notification tokens. </p>
<p>
Communications Between Customers and Chefs. We have an online messaging platform to facilitate messages between Customers and Chefs without sharing either party’s actual phone number with the other. But while we use this messaging to provide the communication service, we collect information about these communications, including the participants’ phone numbers, the date and time, and the contents of messages. For security purposes, we may also monitor or keep the contents of messages made through the Best Local Chef Platform, but we will always let you know we are about to do so before the call begins.</p>	
	<p>
Address Book Contacts. You may set your device permissions to grant Best Local Chef access to your contact lists and direct Best Local Chef to access your contact list, for example to help you refer friends to Best Local Chef. If you do this, we will access and store the names and contact information of the people in your address book.</p>
<p>	
Cookies, Analytics, and Third Party Technologies. We collect information through the use of “cookies”, tracking pixels, data analytics tools like Google Analytics, SDKs, and other third party technologies to understand how you navigate through the Best Local Chef Platform and interact with Best Local Chef advertisements, to make your Best Local Chef experience safer, to learn what content is popular, to improve your site experience, to serve you better ads on other sites, and to save your preferences.
